    <h5>Chester Charles Bennington (March 20, 1976 – July 20, 2017) was an American singer, <br>
        songwriter, and occasional actor. He served as the lead vocalist of the bands  <br>
        Linkin Park, Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise, and Stone Temple Pilots. <br>
<br>
        Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of  <br>
        Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide  <br>
        commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the  <br>
        Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut <br>
        album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales.  <br>
        Linkin Park's following studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017),  <br>
        continued the band's success. <br>
        <br>
        Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The  <br>
        band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the  <br>
        lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the extended play record  <br>
        High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in  <br>
        2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films such as  <br>
        Crank (2006), Crank: High Voltage (2009), and Saw 3D (2010). <br>
    <br>    
        Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most of his life,  <br>
        starting in his childhood. On July 20, 2017, he was found dead at his home in  <br>
        Palos Verdes Estates, California; his death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Hit  <br>
        Parader magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on their list of the "Top 100 Metal  <br>
        Vocalists of All Time". Bennington has been credited by several publications as  <br>
        one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation. Writing for Billboard, Dan  <br>
        Weiss stated that Bennington "turned nu-metal universal".</h5><br>
